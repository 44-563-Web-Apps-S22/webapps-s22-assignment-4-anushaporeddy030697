        <h3>Tartuffe</h3>
        <h5>Act 2<br>Madame Pernelle, visiting her son Orgon's house, uses the opportunity to criticize all the members of the house and to praise their boarder, Tartuffe, because he is a man of such holiness and zeal. The others present offer objections to Tartuffe, maintaining that he is false and hypocritical, but Madame Pernelle will not entertain such thoughts. As she leaves, she admonishes everyone to follow Tartuffe's precepts. </h5>
        <h6>Orgon.</h6> <p> Why?  Is the idea itself so very absurd?</p>
        <h6>Dorine.</h6> <p>  I wouldn't believe it, sir, if you gave your word!</p>
        <h6>Orgon.</h6>  <p>I will make you believe it by-and-by.</p>
        <h6>Dorine.</h6> <p> Yes.  You're going to tell us a bald-faced lie.</p>
        <h6>Orgon.</h6>  <p>I am only saying what you will soon see.</p>
        <h6>Dorine.</h6>  <p>Nonsense!</p>
        <h6>Orgon.</h6>               <p> What I say, dear girl, will soon be.</p>
        <h6>Dorine.</h6> <p> Go on.  Don't believe him!  It's too bizarre!
                    He's joking.</p>
        <h6>Orgon.</h6>  <p>        I say . . .</p>
        <h6>Dorine.</h6>                 <p>No, you've gone too far,
                    And no one believes you.</p>
        <h6>Orgon.</h6> <p>Damn you, you shrew . . .</p>
        <h6>Dorine.</h6> <p> Well, I believe you then; the worse for you.
                    What?  Monsieur, can you pose as one who's sage,
                    Gravely stroking your bearded visage?
                    And still be fool enough to wish . . .</p>
        <h6>Orgon.</h6>   <p>                                    Hear me!
                    I have given you too much liberty,
                    And it no longer gives me any pleasure.</p>
        <h6>Dorine.</h6> <p> Monsieur, please.  Keep your anger within measure.
                    Are you mocking us with your silly plot?
                    Your daughter is no match for a bigot;
                    He has other schemes to worry about.
                    And what would you gain if she wed this lout?
                    With your wealth, what benefit would it bring
                    To pick a bum .</p> </pre>
