        <h3>Tartuffe</h3>
        <h5>Act 2<br>Madame Pernelle, visiting her son Orgon's house, uses the opportunity to criticize all the members of the house and to praise their boarder, Tartuffe, because he is a man of such holiness and zeal. The others present offer objections to Tartuffe, maintaining that he is false and hypocritical, but Madame Pernelle will not entertain such thoughts. As she leaves, she admonishes everyone to follow Tartuffe's precepts. </h5>
